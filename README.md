## What does the package do?

This package generates a monochrome palette from a starting colour for a
specified number of colours. Users can decide whether to go darker,
lighter, or both ways from that starting colour, which can be provided
as a vector of rgb values (e.g. `c(15, 75, 99)`), a hex colour code
(e.g. `#0F4B63`) or a recognised colour name (e.g. `"purple"`). The
package can also display the generated palette in the plot window, with
or without hex colour code labels.

## How can I use it?

This package is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), so can
be installed using `install.packages("monochromeR")`.

Alternatively, to install it from here, use
`remotes::github_install("cararthompson/monochromeR")`. (To do this, you
need to have installed the `remotes` package. To do that, use
`install.packages("remotes")`.)

## Can we see some examples?

Sure! Here goes. To make the examples easy to read, I will use
recognised colour names rather than hex codes or rgb values.

### Generate monochrome palettes with `generate_palette()`

``` r
library(monochromeR)

generate_palette("purple", modification = "go_lighter", 
                 n_colours = 5, view_palette = TRUE)
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)<!-- -->

    ## [1] "#A020F0" "#B34CF3" "#C679F6" "#D9A5F9" "#ECD2FC"

The functions allow for British spelling and US spelling of
colour/color.

``` r
generate_palette("purple", modification = "go_darker", 
                 n_colors = 5, view_palette = TRUE, view_labels = FALSE)
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

    ## [1] "#A020F0" "#8019C0" "#601390" "#3F0C5F" "#200630"

With more colours, the hex codes get harder to view in the plot. They
are printed in the console when the function is called on its own, and
can also be assigned to an object for later use.

``` r
purple_palette <- generate_palette("purple", modification = "go_both_ways", 
                                   n_colours = 20, view_palette = TRUE, view_labels = FALSE)
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
purple_palette
```

    ##  [1] "#ECD2FC" "#E4C0FA" "#DCAEF9" "#D59CF8" "#CD8BF7" "#C679F6" "#BE67F4"
    ##  [8] "#B655F3" "#AF43F2" "#A731F1" "#A020F0" "#931DDC" "#861AC9" "#7918B6"
    ## [15] "#6C15A3" "#601390" "#53107C" "#460E69" "#390B56" "#2C0843"

And just because it was easy to implement, this function can also be
used to blend two colours together:

``` r
generate_palette("purple", blend_colour = "green", 
                 n_colours = 10, view_palette = TRUE, view_labels = FALSE)
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

    ##  [1] "#A020F0" "#9133DA" "#8347C5" "#755BB0" "#676F9A" "#588385" "#4A9670"
    ##  [8] "#3CAA5A" "#2EBE45" "#20D230"

### Get the hex colour code from an rgb or rgba vector

``` r
# Get hex code from rgb
rgb_to_hex(c(15, 75, 99))
```

    ## [1] "#0F4B63"

``` r
# Get hex code from rgba
rgba_to_hex(c(15, 75, 99, 0.8))
```

    ## [1] "#3E6E82"

#### View any palette, with or without labels

``` r
view_palette(c("red", "yellow", "purple", "green"), view_labels = FALSE)
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
view_palette(c(wesanderson::wes_palettes$Moonrise1,
               wesanderson::wes_palettes$Moonrise2[1:2]))
```

## Easily pass the output to functions which check accessibility

Version 0.1.3 onwards exports a ggplot object, which can be passed to
functions such as colorblindr::cvd_grid() to check how the palette is
perceived by people with different visual perception. With
`view_labels = TRUE`, the labels are displayed in black and white on top
of the colour, to allow users to easily see how readable the text is.

``` r
view_palette(c("red", "yellow", "purple", "green"), view_labels = TRUE)
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
colorblindr::cvd_grid()
```

## Worked examples: using `monochromeR` within datavisualisations

### Using `generate_palette` within `scale_colour_manual()`

Here’s a simple example, using `{monochromeR}`’s `generate_palette()` to
create a colour palette on the fly within `ggplot()`.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(monochromeR)

penguin_plot <- palmerpenguins::penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm, 
                 colour = species, size = body_mass_g),
             alpha = 0.8) +
 
  labs(title = "Perfectly proportional penguins", 
       subtitle = "\nEach dot represents a penguin. The bigger the dot, the heavier the penguin. \nLook at them go!",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Bill length (mm)") +
   scale_size(guide = "none") +
 guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "")) +
  theme_minimal() 

penguin_plot
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
penguin_plot <- penguin_plot +
 scale_colour_manual(values = generate_palette(c(15, 75, 99), 
                                    modification = "go_both_ways", 
                                    n_colours = 3))

penguin_plot
```

### Creating a unified aesthetic across all aspects of the dataviz

Here’s an example using `{monochromeR}`’s `generate_palette()` to
generate all the colours used in the plot, resulting in a more polished
look with minimal effort.

``` r
penguin_palette <- generate_palette(c(15, 75, 99), 
                                    modification = "go_both_ways", 
                                    n_colours = 8,
                                    view_palette = T,
                                    view_labels = F)
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
penguin_plot +
  theme_minimal() %+replace%
    theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = penguin_palette[8], 
                                         colour = penguin_palette[8]),
          panel.grid = element_line(colour = penguin_palette[7]),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = penguin_palette[8], 
                                          colour = penguin_palette[8]),
          text = element_text(colour = penguin_palette[3]),
          axis.text = element_text(colour = penguin_palette[3]),
          plot.title = element_text(colour = penguin_palette[1], hjust = 0, size = 16),
          plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = penguin_palette[2], hjust = 0))
```

### Bugs and queries

I’ve done my best to make the functions in this package user-friendly,
and to make the error messages easy to understand. If you come across a
bug or an error message that doesn’t make sense, or if there’s something
you think would make this package better, [please let me
know](https://github.com/cararthompson/monochromeR/issues)!
