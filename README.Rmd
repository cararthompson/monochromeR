## What does the package do?

This package generates a monochrome palette from a starting colour for a specified number of colours. Users can decide whether to go darker, lighter, or both ways from that starting colour, which can be provided as a vector of rgb values (e.g. `c(15, 75, 99)`), a hex colour code (e.g. `#0F4B63`) or a recognised colour name (e.g. `"purple"`). The package can also display the generated palette in the plot window, with or without hex colour code labels. 


## How can I use it?

To install it, use `remotes::github_install("cararthompson/monochromeR")`. 


## Can we see some examples?

Sure! Here goes. To make the examples easy to read, I will use recognised colour names rather than hex codes or rgb values. 

```{r}
library(monochromeR)

generate_palette("purple", modification = "go_lighter", n_colors = 5, view_palette = T)

```


```{r}
generate_palette("purple", modification = "go_darker", n_colors = 5, view_palette = T, view_labels = F)

```


```{r}
generate_palette("purple", modification = "go_both_ways", n_colors = 20, view_palette = T, view_labels = F)

```

And just because it was easy to implement, you can also use this function to blend two colours together:


```{r}
generate_palette("purple", blend_color = "green", n_colors = 10, view_palette = T, view_labels = F)

```


### Why not just use the `alpha` aesthetic?

Having all solid colours allow us to use `alpha` more interestingly (for example, to highlight distance from model predictions), and allows better colour control when the background of the plot isn't white. 


## Does it do anything else?

Yes! The functions that make up `generate_palette()` are useful in and of themselves:

### Get the hex colour code from an rgb or rgba vector

```{r}
# Get hex code from rgb
rgb_to_hex(c(15, 75, 99))


# Get hex code from rgba
rgba_to_hex(c(15, 75, 99, 0.8))

```
### View any palette, with or without labels

```{r}
view_palette(c("red", "yellow", "purple", "green"), view_labels = F)

view_palette(c(wesanderson::wes_palettes$Moonrise1,
               wesanderson::wes_palettes$Moonrise2[1:2]))

```


## Pulling it all together

Here's an example using `monochromeR` to generate all the colours used in the plot, resulting in a unified aesthetic with minimal effort. 

```{r penguin_plot, eval=T, echo=T, warning=F, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(monochromeR)

penguin_palette <- generate_palette(c(15, 75, 99), 
                                    modification = "go_both_ways", 
                                    n_colors = 8,
                                    view_palette = T,
                                    view_labels = F)

palmerpenguins::penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm, 
                 colour = species, size = body_mass_g),
             alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = penguin_palette[c(2,4,6)]) +
  labs(title = "Perfectly proportional penguins", 
       subtitle = "\nEach dot represents a penguin. Across all three species, the longer the penguins' flippers, 
the longer their bills also. Their weight, represented by the size of the dot, is also correlated 
to their flipper and bill lengths. All things in perfect proportion! ",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Bill length (mm)") +
   scale_size(guide = "none") +
 guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "")) +
  theme_minimal() %+replace%
    theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = penguin_palette[8], 
                                         colour = penguin_palette[8]),
          panel.grid = element_line(color = penguin_palette[7]),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = penguin_palette[8], 
                                          colour = penguin_palette[8]),
         legend.position = "top",
          text = element_text(colour = penguin_palette[3]),
          axis.text = element_text(colour = penguin_palette[3]),
          plot.title = element_text(colour = penguin_palette[1], hjust = 0, size = 18),
          plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = penguin_palette[2], hjust = 0, size = 10))
  

```
